In February 2018 we [reported on suspicious patterns in new 'gender pay gap' figures](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42611365).

In response to new rules requiring businesses to publish pay figures, a number claimed to have 50% male and 50% female staff.

**Colin George** and **Dan Wainwright** worked on the story, getting a response from the Government Equalities Office (who said it was "statistically improbable" and called on firms to check their information), The Fawcett Society, workforce analytics company Staffmetrix, the company with the biggest gender pay gap so far - women's fashion chain Phase Eight - and two of the companies that reported absolute equality: McDonald's in Newcastle's Northumberland Street and Fore Street Employment Agency.
